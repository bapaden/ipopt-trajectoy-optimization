#This project passes a nonlinear optimization to IPOPT 


1) IPOPT can be downloaded with:

git clone -b stable/3.12 https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt.git CoinIpopt

2) Before compiling IPOPT you need hsl. It is not open source, but a free copy can be requested from 

http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/ 

3) Compile and install hsl as follows:

	a) extract the copresses binaries into some directory "DIR/"
	b) next move the files from DIR/include into usr/local/include and DIR/lib into usr/local/lib and DIR/lib/pkgconfig into usr/local/pkgconfig
	c) run ldconfig to map the package names to the directory:
		sudo ldconfig

4) Now compile and install IPOPT:

	cd .../CoinIpopt
	./configure
	make
	make install
	make test

5) If there are issues with make test, it is likely hsl was not installed correctly
